# Personal
I am originally from India and grew up in Bantwala, a beautiful town in Karnataka, India. I 
speak two Indian languages: Kannada and Hindi. I have been trying to learn Tamil and Sanskrit
but it is still a work in progress. Me and my husband have a toddler daughter, who keeps us 
very busy and engaged. I now know more nursery rhymes than I ever hoped to learn :) 

The pandemic has forced me to learn how to cook and turns out, I like it. I mostly depend on 
Hebbar's Kitchen for all the new recipes I try.

# Random Facts
I have tried several metaphorical hats in the past to see if I like them. This is a random
selection of the few things I did.
  <ul>
   <li> Completed the SF half marathon in 2015.</li>
   <li> Completed a ten day complete silence meditation course, called Vipassana twice. Vipassana is an ancient 
   meditation technique originally taught by Gouthama Buddha. It involves observing your breath and your thoughts without
   any judgment.</li>
   <li> I like table tennis and was captain of D.K  district's Table tennis team for 2 years.</li>
   <li> I was a girl scout during my  high school years and I have received a Rashtrapathi award (President's award).</li>
   <li> Received black belt in Karate at the age of 10.</li>
   <li> Received training in Karnatic classical music and Bharathanatyam and have sincerely
   abandoned both.</li>
   <li> My parents are both verterniary doctors, so growing up, I used to occassionaly assist them in treatment and surgeris. I'd
   love to do that again if I get a chance.</li>
  </ul>
