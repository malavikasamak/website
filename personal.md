# Personal
I am originally from India and grew up in Bantwala, a beautiful town in Karnataka, India. I 
speak two Indian languages: Kannada and Hindi. I have been trying to learn Tamil and Sanskrit
but it is still a work in progress. Me and my husband have a toddler daughter, who keeps us 
very busy and engaged. I now know more nursery rhymes than I ever hoped to learn :) 

The pandemic has forced me to learn how to cook but as it turns out, I like it. I depend on 
[Hebbar's Kitchen] for all the recipes.  

# Random Facts
I have tried several metaphorical hats in the past to see what fits. This is a random
set of things I did.
  
   1) Completed the SF half marathon in 2015.

   2) Cleaned a disgusting street corner near IISc, Bangalore over one weekend. It was with a group who are called [The Ugly Indian].
    
   3) Completed a ten day complete silence meditation course, called [Vipassana] twice. Vipassana is an ancient 
   meditation technique originally taught by Gouthama Buddha. It involves observing your breath and your thoughts without
   any judgment.

   4) I like table tennis and was captain of D.K district's table tennis team for 2 years.
   
   5) I was a girl scout during my  high school years and I have received a [Rashtrapathi award]. (President's award).
   
   6) Received black belt in Karate at the age of 10.
   
   7) Received training in [Carnatic] classical music and [Bharathanatyam] as a kid, but have abandoned both.
    
   8) My parents are both verterniary doctors, so growing up, I used to occasionally assist them in treatment and surgeries. I'd
   love to do that again if I get a chance.
