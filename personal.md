<h1> Personal </h1>
I am originally from India and grew up in <a href="https://youtu.be/BfKtrj454N4">Bantwala</a>, 
a beautiful town in <a href="https://www.karnatakatourism.org/gallery/">Karnataka, India</a>. I can
speak two Indian languages: [Kannada] and [Hindi] and am currently trying to learn [Tamil].
The pandemic has forced me to learn how to cook. Check out
[Hebbar's Kitchen], she has some of the best South Indian recipes.  

# Random Facts
I have tried several metaphorical hats in the past to see what fits. This is a random
selection of things I did.

   1) Completed the SF half marathon.

   2) Volunteered for [The Ugly Indian].
    
   3) Completed a ten day complete silence meditation course, called [Vipassana] twice. Vipassana is an ancient 
   meditation technique originally taught by Gouthama Buddha. It involves observing your breath and your thoughts without
   any judgment.

   4) Captain of my district's table tennis team for 2 years.
   
   5) I was a girl scout ([BSG]) and I have received a [Rashtrapathi award]. (President's award).
   
   6) Received black belt in Karate \([Shotokan]\) when I was 10.
   
   7) Received training in [Carnatic] classical music and [Bharathanatyam] as a kid.
    
   8) My parents are both verterniary doctors, so I used to occasionally assist them in treatment and surgeries. I'd
   love to do that again if I get a chance.

   9) Hiked a few state and national parks in the US.
