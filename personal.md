<h1> Personal </h1>
I am originally from India and grew up in <a href="https://youtu.be/BfKtrj454N4">Bantwala</a>, 
a beautiful town in <a href="https://www.karnatakatourism.org/gallery/">Karnataka, India</a>. I can
speak two Indian languages: [Kannada] and [Hindi]. I am currently trying to learn [Tamil].
The pandemic has forced me to learn how to cook. I refer to
[Hebbar's Kitchen] for most of the South Indian recipes.  

# Random Facts
I have tried several metaphorical hats to see what fits. This is a random
selection of things I did.

   1) Completed the SF half marathon.

   2) Volunteered with [The Ugly Indian] group.
    
   3) Completed ten day long meditation [course] called Vipassana, twice. [Vipassana] is an ancient 
   meditation technique originally taught by Gouthama Buddha. It involves observing your breath and your thoughts without
   any judgment.

   4) Captain of my district's table tennis team for 2 years.
   
   5) I was a girl scout ([BSG]) and I have received a [Rashtrapathi award] \(President's award\).
   
   6) Received black belt in Karate \([Shotokan]\) when I was 10.
   
   7) Received training in [Carnatic] classical music and [Bharathanatyam] as a kid.
    
   8) My parents are both veterinary doctors, so I used to occasionally assist them in treatment and surgeries. I'd
   love to do that again if I get a chance.
