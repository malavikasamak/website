I"¯<h1> About Me </h1>
<p>I am a Postdoctoral Associate at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL, MIT</a> working with <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/">Prof. Martin Rinard</a>. 
I received my PhD from <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">IISc, Bangalore</a> and my PhD was supported 
by a <a href="https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/?category=2015">Google India PhD fellowship</a>. My research interests are in programming 
languages and software engineering: static and dynamic program analysis, software testing 
and reliability, code search, code generation and code migration. My long term goal is
to build analyses that can improve developer productivity and software reliability.</p>

<p>I have worked on synthesizing targeted multithreaded tests 
for detecting concurrency bugs in software libraries, improving the precision
of dynamic analysis for bug detection, synthesizing adapters 
to enable software library replacement and applying program synthesis for optimizing database queries. 
Currently, I am working on efficient search techniques to identify replacement 
Java classes from large search spaces.</p>

<h3> I am on the job market this year!</h3>
