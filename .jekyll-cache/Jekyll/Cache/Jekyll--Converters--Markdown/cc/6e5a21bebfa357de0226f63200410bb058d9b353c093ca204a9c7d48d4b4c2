<p>I am interested in building systems that enable developers
to maximize the available resources. One such resource that
I have been looking into recently is: code reuse. Enormous amount 
of code has been built in the past few decades and a siginficant 
chunk is available in the form of binaries and/or source code to the
public. Developers take an active interest in contributing
to open source projects and open sourcing their own projects.
As of 2021, GitHub hosts about [200 million] repositories and 
this number is expected to increase over time. Therefore, it
is ideal to reuse code that is already available instead of
building more code, when feasible.</p>

<p>To achieve this we are going to need frameworks that help the
developer to navigate this code jungle. I am interested in
addressing the new challenges that arise with this unique
opportunity. I think, program analysis will soon be more essential
that it has ever been and we need to build techniques that can
tackle code in large magnitudes.</p>

<p><b> Searching for Classes </b></p>

<p>Software developers must often replace existing components in
their systems to adapt to evolving environments or tooling. While
 traditional code search systems are effective at retrieving components 
 with related functionality, it is much more challenging to
 retrieve components that can be used to directly replace existing
 functionality, as replacements must account for more fundamental 
 program properties such as type compatibility. To address this
 problem, we have built ClassFinder, a system which given a query
 class Q, and a search corpus S, returns a ranked subset of classes
 that can replace Q and its functionality.</p>

<p>More details on ClassFinder will be available soon!</p>
