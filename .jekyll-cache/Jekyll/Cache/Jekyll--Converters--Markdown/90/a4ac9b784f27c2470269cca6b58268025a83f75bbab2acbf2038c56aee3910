I"<h1> Personal </h1>
<p>I am originally from India and grew up in <a href="https://youtu.be/BfKtrj454N4">Bantwala</a>, 
a beautiful town in <a href="https://www.karnatakatourism.org/gallery/">Karnataka, India</a>. I can
speak two Indian languages: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada">Kannada</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi">Hindi</a>. I am currently trying to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language">Tamil</a>.
The pandemic has forced me to learn how to cook. I refer to
<a href="https://hebbarskitchen.com/">Hebbar’s Kitchen</a> for most of the South Indian recipes.</p>

<h1 id="random-facts">Random Facts</h1>
<p>I have tried several metaphorical hats to see what fits. This is a random
selection of things I did.</p>

<p>3) Completed ten day long meditation <a href="https://paphulla.dhamma.org/reference/code-of-discipline/">course</a> called Vipassana, twice. <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/">Vipassana</a> is an ancient 
   meditation technique originally taught by Gouthama Buddha. It involves observing your breath and your thoughts without
   any judgment.</p>

<p>5) I was a girl scout (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bharat_Scouts_and_Guides">BSG</a>) and I have received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtrapati_Award">Rashtrapathi award</a> (President’s award).</p>

<p>6) Received black belt in Karate (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan">Shotokan</a>) when I was 10.</p>

<p>8) My parents are both veterinary doctors, so I used to occasionally assist them in treatment and surgeries. I’d
   love to do that again if I get a chance.</p>
