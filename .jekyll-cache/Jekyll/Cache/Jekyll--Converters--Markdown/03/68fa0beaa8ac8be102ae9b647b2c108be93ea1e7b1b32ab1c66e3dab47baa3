I"ì<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Postdoctoral Associate at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL, MIT</a> working with <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/">Prof. Martin Rinard</a>. I received my PhD from <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">IISc, Bangalore</a> and my PhD was supported by a <a href="https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/">Google India PhD fellowship</a>.
My research interests are in programming languages and software engineering. I am interested in building techniques and tools that can improve developer productivity and software reliability.</p>

<p>In the past I have worked on synthesizing targeted multi-threaded tests for detecting concurrency bugs in software libraries, improving the precision
of dynamic analysis for bug detection, synthesizing adapters to enable software library replacement and applying program synthesis for optimizing database queries.</p>

<p>Currently, I am building search techniques to search for alternate libraries that implement similar
functionality as a given library. I have built a tool named ClassFinder, that can search for similar 
Java classes as a query class. ClassFinder has shown promising results and is able to find similar
classes from a search space as large as 600 thousand classes.</p>
