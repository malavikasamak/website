I"“<h1 id="personal">Personal</h1>
<p>I am originally from India and grew up in Bantwala, a beautiful town in Karnataka, India. I 
speak two Indian languages: Kannada and Hindi. I have been trying to learn Tamil and Sanskrit
but it is still a work in progress. Me and my husband have a toddler daughter, who keeps us 
very busy and engaged. I now know more nursery rhymes than I ever hoped to learn :)</p>

<p>The pandemic has forced me to learn how to cook but as it turns out, I like it. I depend on 
<a href="https://hebbarskitchen.com/">Hebbarâ€™s Kitchen</a> for all the recipes.</p>

<h1 id="random-facts">Random Facts</h1>
<p>I have tried several metaphorical hats in the past to see if I like them. This is a random
selection of the few things I did.</p>

<p>1) Completed the SF half marathon in 2015.</p>

<p>2) Cleaned a disgusting street corner near IISc, Bangalore over one weekend. It was with a group who are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_Indian">The Ugly Indian</a>.</p>

<p>3) Completed a ten day complete silence meditation course, called <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/">Vipassana</a> twice. Vipassana is an ancient 
   meditation technique originally taught by Gouthama Buddha. It involves observing your breath and your thoughts without
   any judgment.</p>

<p>4) I like table tennis and was captain of D.K districtâ€™s table tennis team for 2 years.</p>

<p>5) I was a girl scout during my  high school years and I have received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtrapati_Award">Rashtrapathi award</a>. (Presidentâ€™s award).</p>

<p>6) Received black belt in Karate at the age of 10.</p>

<p>7) Received training in Karnatic classical music and Bharathanatyam and have sincerely
   abandoned both.</p>

<p>8) My parents are both verterniary doctors, so growing up, I used to occasionally assist them in treatment and surgeries. Iâ€™d
   love to do that again if I get a chance.</p>
