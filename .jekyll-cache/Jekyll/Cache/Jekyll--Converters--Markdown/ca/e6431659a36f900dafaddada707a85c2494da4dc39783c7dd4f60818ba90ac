I"Û<h1> Personal </h1>
<p>I am originally from India and grew up in <a href="https://youtu.be/BfKtrj454N4">Bantwala</a>, a beautiful town in Karnataka, India. I 
speak two Indian languages: Kannada and Hindi and am trying to learn Tamil.
The pandemic has forced me to learn how to cook. I depend on 
<a href="https://hebbarskitchen.com/">Hebbarâ€™s Kitchen</a> for some all the South Indian recipes.</p>

<h1 id="random-facts">Random Facts</h1>
<p>I have tried several metaphorical hats in the past to see what fits. This is a random
set of things I did.</p>

<p>1) Completed the SF half marathon in 2015.</p>

<p>2) Volunteered for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_Indian">The Ugly Indian</a>.</p>

<p>3) Completed a ten day complete silence meditation course, called <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/">Vipassana</a> twice. Vipassana is an ancient 
   meditation technique originally taught by Gouthama Buddha. It involves observing your breath and your thoughts without
   any judgment.</p>

<p>4) I like table tennis and was captain of my districtâ€™s table tennis team for 2 years.</p>

<p>5) I was a girl scout during my  high school years and I have received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtrapati_Award">Rashtrapathi award</a>. (Presidentâ€™s award).</p>

<p>6) Received black belt in Karate at the age of 10.</p>

<p>7) Received training in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music">Carnatic</a> classical music and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatanatyam">Bharathanatyam</a> as a kid, but have abandoned both.</p>

<p>8) My parents are both verterniary doctors, so growing up, I used to occasionally assist them in treatment and surgeries. Iâ€™d
   love to do that again if I get a chance.</p>
