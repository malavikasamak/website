I"Ò<h1> Personal </h1>
<p>I am originally from India and grew up in <a href="https://youtu.be/BfKtrj454N4">Bantwala</a>, 
a beautiful town in Karnataka, India. I can
speak two Indian languages: Kannada and Hindi and am currently trying to learn Tamil.
The pandemic has forced me to learn how to cook. Check out
