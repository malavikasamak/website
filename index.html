I am a Postdoctoral Associate at CSAIL, MIT working with Prof. Martin Rinard. Before this, I was a PhD student at IISc, Bangalore and before that I was a software engineer at CISCO systems. My PhD was supported by a Google India PhD fellowship.

My research interests are in programming languages and software engineering. I am interested in building techniques and tools that can improve developer productivity and software reliability.
